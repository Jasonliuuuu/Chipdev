Prompt
Given a stream of input bits, pulse a 1 on the output (seen) whenever a specified 5-bit target sequence is detected on the input (din). The target sequence is specified by init and is updated whenever the reset-low signal (resetn) is deasserted.

The target sequence is always a 5-bit value, so left-padded 0's are also considered part of the sequence (a sequence specified as b11 would actually be b00011).

When resetn goes active, all previously seen bits on the input are no longer considered when searching for the target sequence.

Input and Output Signals
clk - Clock signal
resetn - Synchronous reset-low signal
init - Target sequence to detect. Updated whenever resetn is asserted
din - Input bits
seen - 1 if the sequence specified by init was detected, 0 otherwise
Output signals during reset
seen - 0 when resetn is active
