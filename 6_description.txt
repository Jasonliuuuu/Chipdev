Prompt
Build a circuit that pulses dout one cycle after the rising edge of din. A pulse is defined as writing a single-cycle 1 as shown in the examples below. When resetn is asserted, the value of din should be treated as 0.

Bonus - can you enhance your design to pulse dout on the same cycle as the rising edge? Note that this enhancement will not pass our test suite, but is still a useful exercise.

Input and Output Signals
clk - Clock signal
resetn - Synchronous reset-low signal
din - Input signal
dout - Output signal
Output signals during reset
dout - 0 when resetn is active
