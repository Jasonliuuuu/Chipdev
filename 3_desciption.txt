Prompt
Divide an input number by a power of two and round the result to the nearest integer. The power of two is calculated using 2DIV_LOG2 where DIV_LOG2 is a module parameter. Remainders of 0.5 or greater should be rounded up to the nearest integer. If the output were to overflow, then the result should be saturated instead.
