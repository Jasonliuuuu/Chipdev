Prompt
Build a module which controls a stopwatch timer.

The timer starts counting when the start button (start) is pressed (pulses) and increases by 1 every clock cycle. When the stop button (stop) is pressed, the timer stops counting. When the reset button (reset) is pressed, the count resets to 0 and the timer stops counting.

If count ever reaches MAX, then it restarts from 0 on the next cycle.

stop's functionality takes priority over start's functionality, and reset's functionality takes priority over both stop and start's functionality.

Input and Output Signals
clk - Clock signal
reset - Synchronous reset signal
start - Start signal
stop - Stop signal
count - Current count
Output signals during reset
count - 0 when reset is active
